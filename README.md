Assignment: Simple Library Management System

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to develop a simple Library Management System using object -oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C#. This assignment will help you enhance your understanding and expertise in OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Instructions:

1. Create a class called "Book" with the following attributes:

Title (string)

Author (string)

ISBN (string)

Publication Year (int)

Available (bool)

2. Implement appropriate getter and setter methods for each attribute in the "Book" class.

3. Create another class called "Library" with the following attributes:

Books (List of Book objects)

4. Implement a constructor for the "Library" class that initializes an empty list of books

5. Implement the following methods in the "Library" class:

AddBook: This method should take a Book object as a parameter and add it to the list of books in the library. â€¢ RemoveBook: This method should take the ISBN of a book as a parameter and remove

the corresponding book from the list of books in the library.

DisplayBooks: This method should display the details of all the books in the library.

6. Create an instance of the "Library" class in your program's entry point (e.g., the Main method).

7. Test your implementation by adding multiple books to the library using the "AddBook" method,

removing a book using the "RemoveBook" method, and displaying all the books using the

"DisplayBooks" method. 8. Ensure that the class design follows the principles of encapsulation, where the internal state of objects is protected and accessed through public methods.

9. Implement appropriate error handling to handle scenarios such as adding a duplicate book,

removing a non-existent book, etc. 10. Demonstrate the usage of OOP principles such as inheritance or polymorphism by extending the functionality of the "Book" class or adding additional classes (e.g., "Fiction Book" and

"NonFictionBook" subclasses).

Deliverables:

Submit the C# source code files containing the implementation of the "Book" and "Library" classes, along

with a separate file (e.g., README.txt or a code comment) providing instructions on how to compile and

run the program. Note: Feel free to add any additional features or functionalities to the Library

Management System as per your understanding and creativity.
